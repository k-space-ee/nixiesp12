# NixiESP

Yet another Nixie clock project!

Some highlights:

* K155ID1 driven IN-12A or IN-12B tubes for hour, minute, seconds
* BS107 driven IN-6 or similar for separation
* ESP8266 for time synchronization and web interface
* LM1117 (3.3V regulator) for logic power supply
* No tube step up converter on-board, pin headers for connecting third party power supply 
* KiCad design with 3D models from http://miniwatt.info
